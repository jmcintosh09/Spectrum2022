						<strong> What is the next course of action you should take?</strong>
						<br>
						Sending the students to time-out does not resolve the issue, and this is a situation that needs careful attention.
						<br>
						<br>
						Although sending the students to the counselor is a good option, it is important that the parents are involved in this discussion.
						Increased parent involvement has been linked to positive social and emotional behaviors, motivation, social competence, and peer relationships.
						There are school rules about threats, and neglecting to do something about these threats can lead to escalation in safety and management issues.
						<br>
						Consider if you, as the teacher, were the one threatened. Would this affect how the situation is handled?
