						<p>
							At your school, teachers must rotate once every other week with playground duty,
							which involves being out on the playground during lunch	time and helping to monitor
							the activities of students on the playground. One day on your shift right before
							the bell rings to end the lunch recess, a student from your class comes up
							and tells you that Jon (another student from your class) is standing over in the
							corner and has been throwing rocks at both the building and in the general direction
							of other students. As you walk over to where Jon is to you, you see he now has a big
							rock in his hand. You first ask Jon to put down the rock and he refuses to
							comply, stating "You can't make me."
