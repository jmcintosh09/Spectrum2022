                    <strong>How should Ms. Peterson handle this situation?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The right answer is: Give him a warning and if he doesn't stop, send him to the principal's office.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Give Jack an opportunity to change his behaviour and if he continues to make inappropriate comments, you will need to inform
					the principal because Jack is being a distraction to the other students.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <strong>
					Should you call Jack's parents?
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    The right answer is: Sure, but first give Jack the opportunity to change his behavior.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    No student wants their parents to know about their behaviour. Give Jack the chance to change his behaviour and if that doesn't work inform the principal and Jack's parents.
