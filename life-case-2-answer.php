						<strong>Clearly, the boys are trying to get attention. So, in this case, does ignoring them be helpful? </strong>
						<br>
						In most of the cases, involving a group seeking for attention, ignoring them would be the first option to do. If it does not work, the next solution would be
						to talk to the boys.
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<div class="info">
						<strong>What is the best way to handle the situation? </strong>
						<br>
						Sometimes, ignoring the students can mislead them, causing them to take the teacher for granted. Talking to the boys and telling them that their behaviour is not advisable can make a change.
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>
					<div class="info">
						<strong>For such students, most of the time, the reason could be the lack of attention at home. Do you consider that? </strong>
						<br>
						Advising the boys not to disturb the class at first is a better way. If they do not listen, it is a better way to find the reason
						behind their acting out which could be the situations at home.
