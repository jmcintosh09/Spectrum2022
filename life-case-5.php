							Doug is a fifth grade student. He is of average size and height for his grade. Doug receives special education services
							under certification as emotionally impaired. Doug has a variety of behaviours that he exhibits throughout the
							day on a daily basis. He typically has a lot of energy and spends time each time going to the RTC room at school-
							Responsible Thinking Classroom. On one particular day, Doug is in his general education class and he is repeatedly
							getting out of his seat. His teacher (whom you will respond as either as yourself or critiquing his/her interventions)
							has repeatedly instructed him to remain seated but for every 3 to 5 minutes, Doug either makes an attempt to get up and
							sharpen his pencil, get a drink, or squirm about in his chair.
