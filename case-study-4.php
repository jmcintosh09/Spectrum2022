                        Melissa is a teaching student and wants to provide her class with real world
                        sciences examples and allow them to use their own thinking skills.
                        Melissa wants to try a problem-solving lab with her tenth-grade biology class.
                        During the lab she expected that her students would make an important connection
                        between genetics concepts and the real world as they determined the genotypic and
                        phenotypic ration for Indian corn. Melissa was excited about the lab, but her students
                        quickly became disengaged and off task. She was left trying to figure out what she did wrong.
