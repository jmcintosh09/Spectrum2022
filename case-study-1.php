                        The teacher does not know how to handle the student who seems to have more experience in the subject. 
                        In science courses it is important for the teacher to take in consideration the answers that students provide.
                        Allow them to participate and offer suggestions for discussion. In this case the teacher was not aware of  Darren's knowledge.
                        For this scenario I would like for pre service teachers or 1st year teachers to be aware of the various  responses that the teacher 
                        could have made towards Darren's excitement and knowledge about simple machines and then be able to  correctly handle the situation 
                        in the classroom which will help students be successful and the teacher confident and in control of the class.
                        Note: Elementary teachers do do have a science background. They rely on their basic science knowledge  from college, 
                        their science method's courses, and science resources provided for them in order to engage students.
