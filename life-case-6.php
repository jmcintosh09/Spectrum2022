						<p>
							Jill is a student in Mr. Smith's class and is not attentive in the class. She is completely 
							disconnected from what is being taught in the class and seems to be in another world.
							At home, Jill's parents fight every day and they went through a nasty divorce. Unfortunately,
							Jill has to witness it.	Mr. Smith met with her parents and mentioned to them about her behaviour.
							But, her parents did not take any action to correct these issues. Her behaviour in class can most 
							likely be attributed to the lack of attention that she gets at home. Everyday in the class, Jill 
							gets up and goes to the bathroom on an average of three times per hour,	and will be gone for at 
							least ten minutes at a time. In addition to that, she was absent for 4 days for a spontaneous 
							trip to a beach. Since she missed many classes, she started to fail most assignments. 
							At times however, Jill tries to win back her peers by making others feel sorry for her.
							To conclude, Jill is a student who is disconnected to the class due to the neglection of parents who have 
							no interest in their daughter's academic success at school.
