						<strong>What is the best possible way to handle this situation? </strong>
						<br>
						The best answer could be talking to Jill about her situation and helping her out. Try explaning to her the classes she missed in your free time.
						<br>
						<br>
					</div>

					<div class="info">
						<strong>Analysing Jill's behaviour, what could be the reason for Jill's lack of interest in class?</strong>
						<br>
						Due to the diffrent spontaneous trips Jill is going, she missed out on many classes. So, when she returned to school, she is
						not able to understand tee new material which is based on the old material. So, she lost interest in what is going on in the class.
						<br>

					</div>

					<div class="info">
						<strong>As Jill's parents are not showing interest in their daughter's academic status, what can you do about them? </strong>
						<br>
						Having concern about their daughter's academic success is a personal choice to Jill's parents. So, you cannot do anything about it except ignore them.
						Making your effort to help Jill is the best way.
